Welcome to the Machine Learning Algorithms Repository. This resource is dedicated to providing clear examples and implementations of both supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. 

## Supervised Learning Algorithms

In the domain of supervised learning, where the model is trained on labeled data, we offer a variety of algorithms, each with its own dedicated folder containing implementation examples, datasets, and supporting documentation.

### Implemented Algorithms:

- **Decision Tree**: A model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.
- **Ensemble Method**: Techniques that combine the predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms to make more accurate predictions than any individual model.
- **Gradient Descent**: An optimization algorithm used to minimize some function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient.
- **K Nearest Neighbors**: A simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases by a majority vote of its k neighbors.
- **Linear Regression**: A linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables.
- **Logistic Regression**: A statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable.
- **Neural Network**: Computational systems inspired by the networks of biological neurons, which are used to estimate or approximate functions that can depend on a large number of inputs.
- **Perceptron**: A type of artificial neuron that uses a threshold function to distinguish between the input being above or below a certain threshold.

## Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

Unsupervised learning involves training on data that has not been labeled, categorized, or identified. The following algorithms are implemented for clustering and dimensionality reduction purposes:

### Implemented Algorithms:

- **K-Means Clustering**: A method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: A statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables.
