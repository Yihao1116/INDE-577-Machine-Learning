# Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository is a collection of supervised machine learning algorithms implemented for educational purposes. Each algorithm is thoroughly explained with code examples and visualizations where applicable. The implementations utilize popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and others to demonstrate the concepts.

## Algorithms

### Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a foundational algorithm in machine learning, used for predicting numerical values based on linear relationships between variables. It is implemented here using both statistical methods and gradient descent optimization.

### Logistic Regression
An extension of linear regression, logistic regression is used for binary classification tasks. It predicts the probability of a binary outcome and is a staple in the machine learning toolkit.

### Decision Tree
Decision trees are versatile algorithms that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. They work by splitting the dataset into branches to make predictions.

### Neural Network
Neural Networks are complex structures modeled after the human brain, capable of capturing non-linear patterns in data. They are used for a wide range of tasks from classification to image and speech recognition.

### Gradient Descent
Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function in various machine learning algorithms, particularly in neural networks.

### K Nearest Neighbors
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a machine learning algorithm that classifies a data point based on how its neighbors are classified, using the majority vote of its nearest neighbors determined by a distance metric like Euclidean distance.

### Ensemble Methods
Ensemble methods combine predictions from several models to improve the overall performance. Techniques such as bagging, boosting, and stacking are included in this category.

### Perceptron
The perceptron is a simple yet fundamental type of artificial neural network used for binary classification. It serves as the building block for more complex neural network structures.

## Dataset Descriptions
Each algorithm comes with a corresponding dataset example, showcasing how the algorithm performs with real-world data. The datasets are varied and include classic examples like the Iris dataset for classification and generated datasets to demonstrate regression tasks.
