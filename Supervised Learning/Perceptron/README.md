## Data Description
The notebook utilizes the `breast_cancer` dataset from `sklearn.datasets`, which includes measurements from breast cancer biopsies. The features represent characteristics of the cell nuclei, and the target variable indicates the presence of breast cancer. The dataset is preprocessed by selecting the first two features and applying `StandardScaler` for normalization.

## Perceptron Implementation
The Perceptron is a simple linear classifier that updates its weights based on the errors made in predictions. This implementation details the model's initialization, the iterative training process, and the prediction method. The perceptron is trained with the standardized features from the breast cancer dataset.
