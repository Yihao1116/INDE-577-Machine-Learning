## Data Description
The notebook utilizes the `wine` dataset from `sklearn.datasets`. It focuses on binary classification, distinguishing class `0` from other classes. The dataset is preprocessed with `MinMaxScaler` for feature scaling and split into training and test sets. The target variable is modified to a binary outcome where class `0` is labeled as `1` and all other classes as `0`.
