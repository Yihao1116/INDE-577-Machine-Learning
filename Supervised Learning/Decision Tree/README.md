## Data Description
The notebook uses the `breast_cancer` dataset from `sklearn.datasets`, which includes features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. It contains characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The dataset is categorized into 'malignant' and 'benign' classes, which are used as labels for training the Decision Tree Classifier.
