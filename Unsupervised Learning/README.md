# Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of unsupervised machine learning methods, aimed at providing an educational resource for understanding these algorithms. The focus is on k-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), demonstrated using Python and libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, with detailed explanations and visualizations.

## Algorithms

### K-Means Clustering
K-means clustering is a widely used technique for partitioning data into k distinct, non-overlapping subsets or clusters. It involves assigning data points to clusters such that each point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean location.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA is a dimensionality reduction method that transforms a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set. It achieves this by identifying the principal components that maximize variance and reduce redundancy and noise.

## Dataset Descriptions
The methods are applied to various datasets, showcasing their utility in real-world scenarios. The datasets include, but are not limited to, customer segmentation data for k-means clustering and feature-dense datasets for PCA to visualize high-dimensional data in lower-dimensional spaces.
