## Data Description

The Penguins dataset from Seaborn's collection is used to demonstrate the K-Means clustering algorithm. Preprocessing includes cleaning of the dataset and standardization of features.

## K-Means Algorithm Implementation

The K-Means clustering function is implemented in a step-by-step manner, starting from the calculation of distances to updating cluster centers. Functions are defined for each step, leading up to the determination of the optimal number of clusters using the silhouette score.

## Results Visualization

The final clustering results are visualized using a scatter plot, which displays the clusters and their calculated centers. The plot provides a visual representation of the data points and their respective clusters for the optimal K value found.
